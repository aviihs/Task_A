# task A

This is the task given by the Vrit Technology Company. This is task A which was mandatory. The task involved creating an interactive layout with a drag-and-drop effect, focusing on three boxes (Top, Main, and Bottom). These boxes were designed to be draggable within a specific container, allowing users to reorder them dynamically. The layout is styled with a modern design featuring flexible and responsive elements, creating a visually appealing user experience.

For this assessment provided by Vrit Technology Company, I worked on creating a dynamic layout with a drag-and-drop effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus was to design a visually appealing and functional interface that allows users to interact with draggable elements within a structured layout.

Using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to implement the interactivity, I strived to make the design both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Through careful attention to detail, I worked to ensure that the user interface not only looks good but also functions efficiently.
